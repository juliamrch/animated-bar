## Overview

Clever Cloud allows you to deploy Scala (and Java) applications built with <acronym title="Simple Build Tool">SBT</acronym>. This document will explain you how to set up your app to run it on our service.

If you're looking to deploy a [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com) application, you can have a look at our dedicated [deployment guide for play framework applications]({{< ref "deploy/application/scala/tutorials/play-framework-2" >}})
